# todo-list

This is just a simple to-do list app I have made using express.

## Prerequisites

You'll need nodejs to run this, yo can check out your node and npm version using

```
npm -v && node -v
```

## Getting Started

After downloading the project you will need to run 

```
npm install
```

### Running the app

After installing all the node modules you are ready to run the server using:

```
node server
```

You can also install nodemon that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. (optional)

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

So, in that case you will execute:

```
nodemon server
```

After that, open a browser and type:

```
localhost:8000
```
